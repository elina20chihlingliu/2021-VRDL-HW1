## âœ“ ML Code Completeness Checklist

The ML Code Completeness Checklist consists of five items:

1. **Requirements**
2. **Files (images,txt and .py)** 
3. **Training code + Evaluation code** 
4. **Evaluation code + Load the models**
5. **Pre-trained models load links**
6. **README file including table of results accompanied by precise commands to run/produce those results**


#### 1. Requirements

'requirements.txt` contains all python 

#### 2. Files (images,txt and .py)

Please put the following files in the same directory.
1. [training_images]
2. [testing_images]
3. [models]
4. [code_explanation]
5. classes.txt
6. testing_img_order.txt
7. training_labels.txt
8. 310706002_main.py
9. 310706002_eval_loadmodels.py

#### 3. Training code + Evaluation code

**310706002_main.py** is full code containing data pre-process, training phase, testing phase and generate answer.txt.\
If you want to retrain models, just run 310706002_main.py (ex: python 310706002_main.py) and you can get answer.txt.\
It may take 1.5~2.5 hours to run 310706002_main.py.
    
#### 4. Evaluation code + Load the models 

**310706002_eval_loadmodels.py** only has testing phase to produce answer.txt. It has to load pretrained models in models file.\
In the models file, there are five models parameters that I pretrained and saved which I used to achieve the baseline.\
If you want to evaluate test data without training model again, run 310706002_eval_loadmodels.py (ex: python 310706002_eval_loadmodels.py) and you can get answer.txt.\
It may take 1~2 hours to run 310706002_eval_loadmodels.py.\
The following is what models file looks like:
\[models]\
---[my_model0]\
---[my_model1]\
---[my_model2]\
---[my_model3]\
---[my_model4]
    
#### 5. ResNet152V2 and Xception models load links

#### 6. code_explanation

[code_explanation]\
---feature_extraction_used_pretained_models.py\
---feature_nowwin.py\
---read_image.py\
code_explanation file includes each segments of the code in 310706002_main.py. 
In order to explain the code more detail, I separated the code into three segments and each of them were saved as python file.
Those python files cannot be executed, because they are only for reading the code in detail including some programming notes.
